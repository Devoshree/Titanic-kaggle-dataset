# Titanic-kaggle-dataset
Titanic dataset analysed through multicass decision forest algorithm working on training and testing dataset.
While working on titanic dataset I came across a great learning experience like how to deal with non-categorical features of dataset or the missing values in a particular feature and the most important to play around with different parameters of a particular algorithm or try hands at different algorithm to best fit the data.
